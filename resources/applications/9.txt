EDAM is the ontology of bioinformatics types of data, data formats, operations, and topics. Among other use cases, EDAM provides bioinformatics-specific terms for text mining, and its concepts may be used when representing linked data.

Bio.Tools is the emerging universal registry for bioinformatics tools, services, and databases. Its scope includes tools and data resources for text mining within computational and molecular biology.

There are a few directions in which EDAM and Bio.Tools may improve, related to text mining and linked data:

* Registering text-mining tools in Bio.Tools
* Improvement of text-mining-related concepts and terms in EDAM
* General testing and improvements of EDAM in text mining
* General testing and improvements of EDAM in representation of linked data
* Gathering further requirements for Bio.Tools and EDAM

I would like to hack in these directions together with other interested participants of #BLAHmuc.
