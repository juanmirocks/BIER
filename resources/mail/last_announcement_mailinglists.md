Dear all,

the [#BLAHmuc symposium & hackathon](http://blahmuc.linkedannotation.org) starts already next Monday, September 19th, and we are ready to create great tools and listen to great talks for BioNLP.

For those who cannot attend in Munich, you are missing out ;-) But don't fret. **We will stream live the event!**. The YouTuve live stream for the talks on Monday and Tuesday starts next Monday here:

Furthermore, we will work and publish results on the [BLAHmuc GitHub repository](https://github.com/juanmirocks/BLAHmuc) and likely publish soon an open google document for everybody to brainstorm ideas.

We hope these efforts facilitate open collaboration and we are really glad if the community (YOU) joins in the discussions and work!

For the latest information, please check the [#BLAHmuc website](http://blahmuc.linkedannotation.org)

Se you on Monday!

With ♥️ \#BLAHmuc Organizers (Rostlab, TUM, DBCLS, and tagtog), Jin-Dong Kim, Inga Weise, Tim Karl, and Juan Miguel Cejuela
