Dear `???`,

I hope you are doing well!! Life is good in `???`?

I write you on the occasion of the BLAHmuc hackathon The hackathon‚Äôs topic is on biomedical text mining and I chair it! We will have many participants and is looking good.

The problem is that we have very limited funding. I write you in case you could give me the contact of somebody at Microsoft, from the press or marketing for example, likely from Munich. We want to ask for some funding support, if that‚Äôs possible. Of course we will be happy to highlight Microsoft at the conference.

Do you think you can do something? Below I copy a general email we are sending to institutions, if that helps.

Please let me know any details I can provide you.

I thank you a lot for this favor üôè
