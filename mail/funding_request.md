#BLAHmuc Hackathon

Dear `???`,

my name is Juan Miguel Cejuela, a PhD student at TU Munich, under Prof. Dr. Burkhard Rost.

I write you as I thought your institution could profit from the [BLAHmuc hackathon](http://blahmuc.linkedannotation.org) to be celebrated this September 19-23, in Munich. The goal of the hackathon is to improve the web APIs of text mining services for the benefit of the biomedical community. Selected participants provide solutions for the finding of diseases, drugs, or other biological ontologies in the scientific literature. All results will be made public and open source. The hackathon is jointly co-organized by [Rostlab](https://rostlab.org), [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/), [DBCLS](http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/en), and [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net).

We are offering exposure at the event in exchange of funding support. We will be happy to count with your sponsorship at any possible capacity and even, if so you please, count with your participation at the event. We are considering sponsorship quotes ranging from €100 up to €10,000.

If you think you could benefit from the efforts and sponsorship of the BLAHmuc hackathon, we will be happy to provide you with all the exposure we can.

Thank you so much and have a great day.
