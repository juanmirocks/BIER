# #BLAHmuc hackathon, Sept 19-23 Munich, Call

# [#BLAHmuc hackathon](http://blahmuc.linkedannotation.org) - September 19-23, 2016 @ Munich

## Call for Applications

\#BLAHmuc is a one-week hackathon plus symposium co-organized by Rostlab, Technische Universität München, DBCLS, and tagtog. #BLAHmuc is a sister event of BLAH [(Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon)](http://2015.linkedannotation.org/).

We invite annotation tools, developers of text mining methods, and, specially, public biomedical databases and other projects. We ask participants to submit a 1-page description of the project they want to present or accomplish in the #BLAHmuc hackathon. **Deadline: July 24th**.

Our goal is to improve the interoperability of biomedical text mining systems and make them readily usable for final users. In particular, we focus on formalizing REST APIs and exchange formats, and receive feedback from the final biomedical users to improve those. Together.

The exact program is on the [#BLAHmuc website](http://blahmuc.linkedannotation.org). A confirmed keynote speaker is [Prof. Dr. Burkhard Rost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkhard_Rost).

We will also have the opportunity to enjoy one day at the Oktoberfest in Munich.

**Important**: due to the hectic Oktoberfest period, please contact us without delay regarding hotel reservations. Please advance us your intention of participation as soon as possible: [blahmuc@rostlab.org](mailto:blahmuc@rostlab.org)
