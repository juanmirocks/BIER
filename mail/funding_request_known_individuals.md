Dear `???`,

I hope you are doing well.

we are co-organizing the [BLAHmuc hackathon](http://blahmuc.linkedannotation.org), this September 19-23, Munich. The goal of the hackathon is to improve the web APIs of text mining services for the benefit of the biomedical community. Selected participants offer solutions for the finding of diseases, drugs, or other biological ontologies in the scientific literature. All results are made public and open source.

Quite frankly, we are looking for funding support.

If you think that **`???`** could benefit from the sponsorship of the hackathon, we will be happy to provide you with all the exposure we can.

Below I copy a more formal email that you could pass along.

Thank you!
