Dear Hans-Werner Mewes group,

my name is Juan Miguel Cejuela. I write you as a member of Rostlab at TU Munich, bioinformatics chair.

I wanted to inform you about the [BLAHmuc hackathon](http://blahmuc.linkedannotation.org) that we are co-organizing as it may well benefit you.

The hackathon's goal is to improve the interoperability of text mining systems and make them useful for the biomedical community. I think this is relevant for your group. We are inviting annotation tools, developers of text mining methods, and, specially, public biomedical databases and other projects.

The hackathon is in the week of September 19-23, Munich.

We would be very happy if this could be a venue of participation between our groups and would be thrilled by your participation by one or some of your members.

Please, let me know any question you may have.

Thank you so much.
